# CSC-Python-Puzzles
Python puzzles I made but mostly stole for the computer science club

## Puzzles are categorized into folders:
- Beginner -> If you are new to python, start here
- Intermediate -> If you took 1 - 2 years of programming at school, these are probably your level
- Advanced-algorithms -> If Intermediate was easy for you, and you are interested in algorithms
- Advanced-application -> If Intermediate was easy for you, and you are interested in applying your skills to real world situations
