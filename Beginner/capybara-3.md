### Using the program from cabybara-2, add the following to the end. Try to understand whats going on. Put "#" in front of a line to prevent "giraffegiraffe" from being printed to the terminal.
```python
# Add your program here
print(myVar + myVar)
myVar = "giraffe"
print(myVar + myVar)
print(myVar + " NEW TEXT!")
```
